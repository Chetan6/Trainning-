UPDATE :  

 command is used to change the present records in a table.
 To update the selected rows, we have to use the WHERE clause; 
 otherwise, all rows would be updated.

 syntax:

             UPDATE table_name    
             SET column1 = value1,   
             column2 = value2....,   
             columnN = valueN    
             WHERE  condition;
